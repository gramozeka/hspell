Really important stuff to be done:
* Inflect correctly all exemplary nouns of the "Complete Nouns Book".
* Extend the list of known verbs, nouns, proper nouns, relation words, etc.
  In this one, the general public could really help.
* We add prefixes without much judgment, a vice that accepts non-words like
  לשמרתי (to guarded) or הלמדנה (the + ladies, learn!). We should be smarter.

Quite important things:
* Support Kinuyim Khavurim for verbs, i.e. לשומרה (to guard her) or הצחקתני (you
  made me laugh). They are surprisingly common in written texts.
* Support the infinitive with different prefixes (not just Lamed) and without
  prefixes ("absolute infinitive"). For example, not only לעבור (to pass) is
  correct, but so is בעוברו (when he passes) and עוברם (their passing).
* A quick, C-based, spell-checker that also has a library API.
* An ispell-like interface to hspell (whether using aspell/ispell
  themselves, or stealing their code and integrating it with hspell).
* Setup to work with KWrite and friends.

Good to have:
* Compression technique that preserves the stem information of words (for the -v
  option).
* Rewrite the whole thing using Uzzi Ornan's transcript internally. This would
  probably induce a simpler, more elegant code, and enable us to add Niqqud
  (Hebrew accentation) to the game sometime in the future.
* Output morfological information about the conjugation. This can help
  understanding the suggested corrections, and have many other implications.
  (see Far-fetched section).
* Add statistics to each conjugation. לשבותך (for your repatriation) is less 
  probable word than לשבת (to sit), and it might help the user to know that.
* An RPM package. Tzafrir?
* Accept words in a ~/.hspell_personal, as aspell does.

Far fetched:
* Add support for Niqqud.
* Make use of the morfological information about the conjugations. Outputing
  morfological information can help the user understand a corrected word, and
  may facilitate word analysis, automatic translations, understanding,
  intelligent search, and more.

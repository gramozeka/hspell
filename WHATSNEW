Release 0.3: (February 2, 2003)

 * Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   1,000 base words and 20,000 inflections. In this release, emphasis has
   been put on adding Hebrew nouns and adjectives.

 * Fixed Makefile behavior in certain case. In particular "make" should work
   regardless of LC_* environment variables. However, as hspell currently
   works on iso8859-8 encoded files, users with a utf8 locale must run the
   "hspell" perl program as "LC_ALL=C hspell" (otherwise, they will see
   error messages from Perl).

 * Added ispell-like "-a" option, for interfacing with LyX.
   If you want to use hspell under LyX you should use Hebrew-enabled LyX
   (version 1.1.6fix4 is known to work). Add the following line to your
   .lyx/lyxrc file:
	\spell_command hspell
   Notice that this prevents using English ispell/aspell from within LyX. 
   If you know of a better configuration, please tell us.
   Notice that if a Hebrew misspelled word is found, it is shown reversed on
   LyX's spellchecker (and so are its corrections). This is about to be
   corrected in future releases of LyX. Also, LyX breaks Hebrew acronyms
   wrongly, and causes hspell to reject them.

   Read http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~dekelts/lyx/instructions2.html for
   Hebrew LyX general instructions.

 * No longer incorrectly recognize שלווום (should be שלוום, "that to their
   hook").

 * The wolig.pl automatic inflector can handle country names, and many more
   country names and nationalities have been added. Note that since I did
   not find a source for "official" country-name spellings in Hebrew, our
   list might contain errors. Please tell us if you know a dictionary or other
   authoritative document which contains the official Hebrew spellings of
   country names.

 * Vocabulary: 189,347 words
               based on 5238 nouns, 927 adjectives, 3568 verb stems, and
	       1203 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.2: (January 5, 2003)
 * Many more nouns, verbs, and other words: around 2500 new base words, and
   40,000 inflections. Emphasis has been given to adding *common* words that
   will appear in typical, modern, documents.
 * Several incorrect words purged or fixed.
 * Wolig.pl (noun inflector) overhaul to better and more consistently handle
   niqqud-less (ktiv male) spelling rules, and to be able to theoretically
   handle at least 99.9% of the Hebrew nouns (of course, we don't have all of
   them in the dictionary, yet :)).
 * -n option to hspell program, which gives longer (human-written) explanations
   on certain spelling errors - especially common niqqud-less spelling errors.
 * Read additional accepted words from ~/.hspell_words and/or ./hspell_words
 * Kinuim Khavurim (possesive suffixes) are recognized on the infinitive forms
   of the verb.
 * Added manual page, hspell(1)
 * Improved Makefile (thanks to Oron Peled) and made other changes to the
   distribution (thanks to Baruch Even) for more easily building binary
   packages of hspell.

 * Vocabulary: 169,266 words
               based on 4505 nouns, 645 adjectives, 3407 verb stems, and
	       1237 other words

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.1: (first public release - December 13, 2002)

 * Vocabulary: 125,022 words
               based on 3206 nouns, 452 adjectives, 2712 verb stems, and
	       980 other words

 * In this release we would like to thank Uwe Brauer and Michael Lugassy for
   "convincing" us to start and to advance this project when we were almost
   ready to give up.

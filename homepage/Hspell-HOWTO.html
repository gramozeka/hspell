<h2><a name="lyx">1. LyX</a></h2>

<p>If you're using a recent version of <a href="http://www.lyx.org"
class="ad">LyX</a> which was compiled with the Qt frontend, just choose
"hspell" in the speller configuration dialog.</p>

<p>If you're using an older version, or if you wish to simultaneously
spell-check Hebrew and English, add the following to <span
class="filename">~/.lyx/preferences</span> (or to <span
class="filename">~/.lyx/lyxrc</span>):</p>

<pre class="conf-file">
\spell_command hspell
## If you wish to spell-check English words as well,
## use the following command instead:
#\spell_command hspell-i

## If LyX was compiled with pspell support,
## uncomment the following.
#\use_pspell false
</pre>

<p>For Hebrew LyX general instructions, <a
href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~dekelts/lyx/instructions2.html"
class="ad">check out Dekel's web-site</a>.</p>

<h3>Known problems with LyX</h3>

<p>LyX breaks up words on quote characters (gershayim) before passing
them to Hspell. This means that spell-checking in LyX will not
understand rashei tevot (acronyms) and gimatria correctly.</p>

<h2><a name="kde">2. KDE</a></h2>

<p><i>Thanks to Meni Livne for contributing this section.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kde.org" class="ad">KDE</a> supports Hebrew spell
checking using Hspell in KDE 3.1.2 and any later version. It allows
spell checking Hebrew text in every KDE application that has
spell-checking features (see note about KOffice below). To use it,
choose "HSpell" in the Spell Checking Configuration dialog accessible
via KControl or through the Configuration dialog of your favorite KDE
application that has spell-checking features.</p>

<p>If you are using a version of KDE prior to KDE 3.1.2 and still want
to have Hebrew spell checking in your KDE applications without
upgrading, see instructions in section 2.1 below.</p>

<p>Note about <a href="http://koffice.kde.org" class="ad">KOffice</a>:
Since KOffice applications use their own spell-checking library and not
the kspell library from kdelibs like all other KDE applications, using a
KDE version that supports Hspell with versions of KOffice prior to
KOffice 1.3 will not suffice. If you want to have Hebrew spell checking
in KOffice applications, upgrade to KOffice 1.3 or later. Configuration
of spell checking in KOffice applications is the same as the rest of
KDE.</p>

<h3><a name="kde-old">2.1 Issues with older KDE versions</a></h3>

<p>KDE 3.1.2 and 3.1.3:</p>

<p>Hspell v0.9 and up (not yet released) can handle words with niqqud
(it simply ignores them). KDE versions prior to KDE 3.1.4 could
communicate with hspell only in the ISO-8859-8 encoding, which cannot
represent niqqud (KDE substitutes "?" for any niqqud character, thus
erroneously making hspell see several words instead of one niqquded
word). One solution is to upgrade your KDE to a version later than
3.1.3. Another solution that does not involve upgrading is to follow the
instructions about KDE &lt; 3.1.2 below on how to patch your kspell
library to recognize the CP1255 encoding, which can represent niqqud. Of
course, if you're not using niqqud in your documents, or if you don't
mind some harmless fikshushim when spell-checking seldom used niqquded
words, you can ignore this problem.</p>

<p>KDE &lt; 3.1.2:</p>

<p>Versions of KDE prior to 3.1.2 did not support Hspell out-the-box.
Nevertheless, it is still possible to have KDE use Hspell with these
versions. There were basically two problems with these versions that
prevented you from using Hspell:</p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>They did not let you choose "hspell" as your speller program.</p>

<p>To circumvent this deficiency, symlink "ispell", or "aspell", to   
"hspell". Then, in the Spell Checking Configuration dialog, choose the   
appropriate "client" program.<p>
   
</li>
<li>

<p>The "ISO-8859-8" encoding (in the Spell Checking Configuration
dialog) was considered <em>visual</em> Hebrew, so Hspell would have been
getting reversed Hebrew.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, patch the kspell library (kspell is KDE's
speller module) to recognize CP1255 through the following steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Find kspell's library file. It's usually <span
class="filename">/usr/lib/libkspell*.so*</span>. From here on we refer
to it as "<span class="filename">LIBKSPELL.SO</span>" and assume it's in
/usr/lib.</li>

<li>Issue the following commands (as root, so be cautious!):
<pre>   
$ cd /usr/lib
$ mv LIBKSPELL.SO LIBKSPELL.SO.bak
$ sed -e 's/CP1251/CP1255/g' LIBKSPELL.SO.bak &gt; LIBKSPELL.SO
$ chmod 755 LIBKSPELL.SO
</pre>
</li>

<li>Select the "CP1255" encoding in the Spell Checking Configuration
dialog.</li>

</ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="kde-multi">2.2 Spell-checking Hebrew and English
simultaneously in KDE</a></h3>

<p>The usual way you'd spell-check multilingual texts in KDE is to first 
spell-check one language, then reconfigure KDE for the other language
and spell-check that other language.</p>

<p>However, using the "multispell" utility provided with the Hspell 
distribution you can spell-check Hebrew and English simultaneously, 
even without having to reconfigure KDE's spell checking settings.</p>

<p>Since "multispell" is not in KDE's Spell Checking Configuration
dialog, you'll have to resort to symlink tricks.</p>

<h2><a name="ooo">3. OpenOffice</a></h2>

<p>The Hebrew version of OpenOffice, available from <a
href="http://openoffice.org.il" class="ad">openoffice.org.il</a>, has Hebrew
spell-checking support that works out-of-the-box. This is true for both the
MS-Windows and the Linux binaries. See the <a href="#mac">Mac
OS X</a> section for info on OOo for the Mac.</p>

<p>However, if you're using a non-Hebrew version of
<a href="http://openoffice.org" class="ad">OpenOffice</a>, you have to
install the Hspell module separately (this is the same module that is built-in
to the Hebrew version). This module already includes Hspell itself together
with its dictionary.</p>

<p>The Hspell module can be installed using an RPM, a binary tarball, or a
source tarball.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>An RPM for Fedora [[TODO: and what other systems?]] is available from:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ivrix.org.il/redhat/fc1/ooo-hspell-0.8-1.i386.rpm">http://ivrix.org.il/redhat/fc1/ooo-hspell-0.8-1.i386.rpm</a></p>

<p>The Hebrew dictionary provided with this RPM is that of Hspell 0.8.</p></li>

<li><p>A binary tarball for Linux systems is available from:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openoffice.org.il/hspell.tar.gz">http://www.openoffice.org.il/hspell.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Then follow the instructions outlined in README_Hspell_addon. In short,
extract hspell_instll.tar into a temporary directory and, probably after
becoming root, execute ./hspell_install.</p>

<p>The Hebrew dictionary provided with this binary tarball is that of Hspell
0.6 (but you can simply overwrite the relevant files with those provided with
Hspell 0.8).</p></li>

<li><p>The source tarball is available from:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.openoffice.org.il/hspell_src.tar.gz">http://www.openoffice.org.il/hspell_src.tar.gz</a></p>
    </li>

</ul>

<p>After successfully installing the module, a new item, "Hspell
Hebrew Spell Checker", will be added to the "Available language modules" list
in the Tools/Options/Language-Settings/Writing-Aids dialog.</p>

<p>To be able to spell-check Hebrew, it's necessary to comply with the
following configuration (all in the Tools/Options/Language-Settings/Languages
dialog):</p>

<ol>
<li>"Complex text layout (CTL) support" must be enabled.</li>
<li>The CTL language (under "Default languages for documents") must be Hebrew.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Known Problems with OpenOffice</h3>

<p>[[TODO]]</p>

<h2><a name="mac">4. Mac OS X</a></h2>

<p>Powered by Hspell, the
<a href="http://mitzpettel.com/software/hspell.html">Hebrew Spelling Service</a>,
by Mitz Pettel, adds a Hebrew spelling dictionary to Mac OS X's built-in
spell checker.</p>

<p>Once the Hebrew Spelling Service is installed, the Hebrew spelling
dictionary can be selected and used in any application that has a standard
Spelling submenu in its Edit menu, such as TextEdit, Mail or Mellel.</p>

<p>Note that OpenOffice will not benefit from the Hebrew Spelling Service
because it does not use the standard spelling interface of the Mac. For a
build of OpenOffice for Mac OS X that does Hebrew spell checking, please
contact <a href="http://www.yeda.co.il">Yeda</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="abiword">5. AbiWord</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.abisource.com" class="ad">AbiWord</a>, thanks to
work done by Yaacov Zamir, now supports Hspell (on Unix-like platforms).</p>

<p>Please visit Yaacov's
<a href="http://hspell-gui.sourceforge.net/abiword.html">Hspell and AbiWord mini-howto</a>
page for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="moz">6. Mozilla</a></h2>

<p>The Hebrew dictionary of Hspell is now available for use with Mozilla. Right
now it's at the <em>BETA</em> stage. It is available at:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ivrix.org.il/redhat/spell-he-IL.xpi">http://ivrix.org.il/redhat/spell-he-IL.xpi</a></p>

<p>This package is suitable for any platform (MS-Windows included) because it
doesn't contain binary code. You can install this package only as
root/administrator.</p>

<p>Next time you run Mozilla and call up the spelling dialog box, you'll be
able to select the Hebrew dictionary by choosing "he-IL" from the Language
menu.</p>

<h3>Known Problems with Mozilla</h3>

<ul>
<li>When the Hebrew dictionary is used, Mozilla reports any non-Hebrew word as
misspelling.</li>
<li>When a Hebrew misspelling is found, too many suggestions are generated, making the
useful ones hard to find.</li>
<li>[[TODO: The extension may not work on Thunderbird 0.7 because the extension
mechanism has been changed.]]</li>
</ul>

<p>(BTW, if you're interested in spell-checking Hebrew in web-pages while you
surf, which is completely unrelated to spell-checking Hebrew in Composer, you
might be interested in

<h2><a name="vim">7. Vim</a></h2>

<p>For <a href="http://www.vim.org" class="ad">Vim</a> 6.x, use <a
href="vimhspell.vim">this script</a>. It supports
bilingual spell-checking and UTF-8 files. The documentation is commented
within the file.</p>

<p>If you encounter problems using the script, please contact
&lt;mooffie <span class="email-spam">@at</span>@ typo.co.il&gt;</p>

<h2><a name="emacs">8. GNU Emacs</a></h2>

<p>The following instructions are known to work with <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" class="ad">GNU
Emacs</a> and with <a href="http://www.m17n.org/emacs-bidi/"
class="ad">BiDi-Emacs</a>. They are known <em>not</em> to work with
XEmacs.</p>

<p>Add the following to your <span class="filename">~/.emacs</span>:</p>

<pre class="conf-file">
;; Settings by Mooffie, with additions by Ehud Karni.

(setq-default ispell-program-name "hspell")

;; for each buffer, uncomment:
;(ispell-change-dictionary "hebrew8")       ;; set hebrew dictionary
;(setq ispell-dictionary "hebrew8")         ;; set it explicitly

;; When flyspell is applied to large regions, the speller is not used
;; in "-a" mode and thus we would not be able to use multispell. The
;; default for "large regions" is 1000 bytes, so we bump it to 30000.
(setq flyspell-large-region 30000)

;; for use of hebrew menus (and flyspell menues) add to your .Xdefaults:
;; emacs.menu.popup.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-c-80-iso8859-8
</pre>

<h3>A sample Emacs session</h3>

<ol>
<li>Launch emacs in the he_IL (ISO-8859-8) locale.</li>
<li>Type some Hebrew into the buffer.</li>
<li>Select the "hebrew8" dictionary: Tools | Spell Checking | Select   
Hebrew8 Dict. (You must repeat that for every buffer you want to
spell-check.)</li>
<li>Spell-check the document: Tools | Spell Checking | Spell-Check
   Buffer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Known problems with Emacs</h3>

<p>Spell-checking UTF-8 files will fail. It seems that there's a bug in 
"ispell.el". Stay tuned.</p>

<h2><a name="geresh">9. Geresh</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.typo.co.il/~mooffie/geresh/"
class="ad">Geresh</a>, starting with version 0.4.0, supports ispell-like
spellers, including Hspell.</p>

<p>Add the following to your <span
class="filename">~/.geresh/gereshrc</span>:</p>

<pre class="conf-file">
--speller-cmd="hspell -a"
--speller-encoding=iso-8859-8

## If you wish to spell-check English words as well,
## uncomment the following:
#--speller-cmd="multispell -a"

## If you wish to see hspell's spelling-hints,
## uncomment the following (but this feature is
## unavailable in hspell 0.6):
#--speller-cmd="multispell -a -n"
</pre>

<h2><a name="problems">10. Known problems</a></h2>

<ul>

<li>While Hspell 0.8 can read words from your personal dictionary file
(<span class="filename">~/.hspell_words</span> or <span
class="filename">./hspell_words</span>), it doesn't implement the
command to <em>update</em> this dictionary. As a consequence, clicking
the "Add to personal dictionary" button (or using the equivalent
command) in your editor will have no effect.</li>

<li>Hspell has troubles with words containing niqqud. It should ignore
such words.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="not-supported">11. Not supported (yet)</a></h2>

<p>The following applications do not support Hspell. Usually that's
because they don't support ispell's pipe mode but instead use some
other API (like pspell).</p>

<ul>
<li>Most GNOME apps (gnome-spell -&gt; pspell)</li>
</ul>

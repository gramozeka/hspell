The Hspell Project
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS=small>"<I>Life, liberty, and the pursuit of spelling errors.</I>"</SPAN><BR>
</H1>

<P>
The Hspell project is a free Hebrew linguistic project.
</P>
<P>
Its primary goal is to create a <B>free Hebrew spell-checker</B>.
We have already achieved that goal, and you are invited to
<A HREF="download.html">Download</A> the latest version of the spell-checker.
It is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>
In
addition to a spell-checker, the project also produced a <B>Hebrew
morphological analyzer</B>, which for every valid Hebrew word lists all of its
possible <I>readings</I> (valid combinations of prefix and inflected base word),
and for each reading describe its part-of-speech, gender, tense, and other
attributes.
</P>
<P>
The secondary goal of the project is to make the algorithms and dictionaries, created
initially for the spell-checker, freely available. These could be used
in more sophisticated
research or applications that require Hebrew word lists or a Hebrew morphology engine.
</P>
<P>
Such potential application areas might include search engines,
speech synthesis, and much much more. The availability of a free basis will
hopefully encourage free development on top of it, to the benefit of the
general Hebrew-speaking population.
</P>

<SPAN class="small">Hspell 1.1 released</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
After a long hiatus, <A HREF="download.html">Hspell 1.1</A> was released.
This release continues to enlarge Hspell's vocabulary and improve its
accuracy, and for
the first time documents <A HREF="niqqudless.pdf">Hspell's spelling standard</A> (in Hebrew).
See the
<A HREF="WHATSNEW">What's New</A> file for more details.
</P>


<H3>March 4, 2009</BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell's Website available again</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
After more than a year that <B>ivrix.org.il</B> has been unavailable and
the Hspell project has been without a site, the project site is back,
thanks to <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</A>.
</P>

<H3>May 16, 2006<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell 1.0 released</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="download.html">Hspell 1.0</A> was released. In this version, Hspell's
vocabulary has grown by 1,500 more base words, reaching a total of over
22,500. We now consider this vocabulary to be mature, and large enough to satisfy most users. As usual, the new version also
features other improvements and bug fixes - see the
<A HREF="WHATSNEW">What's New</A> file for more details.
</P>

<H3>March 12, 2006<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Gmail uses Hspell</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
Google's mail service, <A HREF="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</A>, now
supports spell-checking of Hebrew messages. Internally, it uses Hspell's word list. A mirror of Hspell 0.9 also appears <A HREF="http://code.google.com/mirrored.html">on Google's site</A>.
</P>

<H3>January 13, 2005<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell 0.9 released</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="download.html">Hspell 0.9</A> was released. This version features the biggest
vocabulary increase of any one previous release (2500 words), and is one
of the final steps towards the goal of making Hspell's coverage of the modern
Hebrew language complete.</P>
<P>Additionally, "Personal dictionary" write support
was added to the ispell-like front end, finally enabling the "add word"
feature in applications that use Hspell (such as LyX and KDE). And as usual,
many other improvements and bug fixes were made. See the <A HREF="WHATSNEW">What's
New</A> file for more information.

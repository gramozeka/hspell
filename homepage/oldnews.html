<SPAN class="small">Hspell enables Hebrew spell-checking in multi-lingual spell-checkers</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
For several months now, the multi-lingual spell-checker
<A HREF="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">Aspell</A> includes a
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/he/">Hebrew dictionary</A>,
created automatically from Hspell's data. Recently, we also converted
Hspell's word list and valid prefix information to the similar
<A HREF="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/">MySpell</A> format, used
by the multi-lingual spell-checkers of
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</A>.
</P>
<P>
OpenOffice's dictionary page now lists our <A
	  HREF="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html">Hebrew
	  dictionary</A>, and it can also be automatically installed by the
<A HREF="http://ftp.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/dicooo/DicOOo.sxw">DicOOo</A> dictionary-installation macro. This allows, for the first time,
Hebrew spell-checking on ordinary versions of OpenOffice, on all
platforms (not limited to Linux).
</P>
<P>
To install the Hspell-based Hebrew spell-checker on Mozilla, check out
<A HREF="http://dictionaries.mozdev.org/installation.html">Mozilla's instructions</A>.
</P>
<P>
We started the effort to bring Hspell-based Hebrew spell-checking to
common multi-lingual spell-checkers in April. The success of this
effort validates
our architectural decision of having Hspell <I>generate</I> full word lists,
of the kind that most multi-lingual spell-checkers accept without needing
any Hebrew-specific code to be added to them.
</P>

<H3>July 4, 2004<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell enables Hebrew spell-checking in OpenOffice</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
Alan Yaniger of TkOS recently
<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org.il/">released</A> an add-on package
for the ordinary (English) version of OpenOffice, based on Hspell.
This package allows OpenOffice to spell-check Hebrew in addition to English (you don't need to choose,
each word in a mixed document is checked using the dictionary of the
appropriate language). Alan's package uses, however, antiquated dictionaries
from Hspell 0.6, which are included, uncompressed (!), in the package.
</P>
<P>
We created an easier to install
<A HREF="http://ivrix.org.il/redhat/fc1/ooo-hspell-0.8-1.i386.rpm">RPM version</A>
of this package. This RPM is designed for Fedora Core 1, and assumes that
the OpenOffice RPM is already installed on your system. It includes the
most recent (release 0.8) dictionaries.
</P>

<H3>June 28, 2004<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell bug tracker announced</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
The Hspell project now has a Bugzilla
<A HREF="/bugzilla/">bug tracking system</A>. Users can use this system to
let the developers know of new bugs and missing features, and to track the
progress in solving old ones.
</P>

<H3>June 21, 2004<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell 0.8 released</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="download.html">Hspell 0.8</A> was released. This release continues
to enlarge Hspell's vocabulary, and to improve portability and performance.
It can also be used to build a Hebrew dictionary for the upcoming version 
of Aspell.
The <A HREF="WHATSNEW">What's New</A> file explains these changes in more
detail.
</P>


<H3>April 12, 2004<BR>
<SPAN class="small">Hspell gaining acceptance, Aspell uses Hspell word list</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
After seven public releases and almost a year and a half since the first
one, Hspell has been gaining acceptance as <I>the</I> free-software
Hebrew spell-checker. As you can see in the
<A HREF="download.html">download page</A>, pre-built binary packages of
Hspell are available for several Linux distributions, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
Several software packages make use of Hspell, including the
<A HREF="http://openoffice.org.il">Hebrew version of OpenOffice</A> which
includes Hspell inside. The <A HREF="docs.html">screenshots</A> section is
continuing to grow, showing Hspell integration inside a large number of
editors, word processors, and desktop systems.
</P>
<P>Also, In the last few days,
the Hspell and Aspell authors have completed their effort to fully integrate
Hspell's word list (and information on allowed prefixes for each word)
into <A HREF="http://aspell.net">Aspell</A>, which is striving to become a multi-lingual spell checker.
The <A HREF="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/he">success of this effort</A> will hopefully further improve the penetration
of Hspell and Hebrew spell-checking in desktop systems and free OS distributions.
</P>

<H3>December 22, 2003<BR>

morphological analyzer.

<SPAN class="small">Coverage in PCplus</SPAN>
</H3>
<P>
While waiting patiently for release 0.6 to be released soon (it will be
worth the wait!), you might want to read the article from
the latest issue of PCplus, about
<A HREF="http://pcplus.co.il/article.php?id=119">free software and Hebrew</A>
that is partly about Hspell. The article is in Hebrew.
</P>

</H3>
<P>

</H3>
<A HREF="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003/"><IMG SRC="doc/pii-round-tiny2.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=90 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0></A>
<P>
A new <A HREF="doc/short.ps.gz">article</A> about Hspell was written for the
<A HREF="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2003/">"Yet Another Perl Conference"</A>

approach, explains one part (noun inflection) in a little more details, and
also tries to convince its readers that Perl Is Good :)
</P>
<P>
Nadav will also give a presentation on Hspell in the <A HREF="http://www.pc.co.il/go-linux">Go-Linux</A> conference (April 10, Tel-Aviv, Israel).

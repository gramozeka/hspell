Hspell 0.3 announcement

<P>
This release was made on February 2, which is celebrated in the United States
as
"<A HREF="http://www.groundhog.org/history/tradition.shtml">Groundhog Day</A>".
Groundhog-day is a silly, but fun, tradition used to guess the length of the
winter. They say that if this day sunny, there will be six more weeks of
winter, but if it is cloudy there will be an early spring.</P>
<P>
The question of whether or not the sky is cloudy, is traditionally answered using a
<A HREF="http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/ohc/nature/animals/mammals/woodchuck.shtml">groundhog</A>,
a rodent otherwise known as a <I>woodchuck</I> or <I>marmot</I>. If the
groundhog sees his shadow, it predicts 6 more weeks of winter. In our
announcement, it predicted 6 more weeks without another Hspell announcement :)
</P>
<P>
Forecasting weather using groundhogs has become a full-time (and profitable)
hobby in the small town of
<A HREF="http://www.punxsutawney.com/">Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania</A>. The
people of this town are the ones that kept the Groundhog Day tradition alive
for a hundred years, and it is also the location of the 1993 movie
<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(movie)">Groundhog Day</A>
starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
The final paragraph of the announcement referred to the unfortunate
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/">Columbia Disaster</A> that had
occured just a couple of days earlier, and killed Israeli astronaut
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/columbia/crew/profile_ilanr.html">Ilan Ramon</A>
and six of his crew mates.

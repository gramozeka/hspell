        <U><B><I>Releasing Words On A Cold Evening</I></B></U><BR>
        Whose words these are we truly know.<BR>
        They are ours - let us share them all.<BR>
        We would not agree to be stopping here<BR>
        To watch our words fill up with faults.<BR>
        Our little spellchecker must think it's clear<BR>
        To be released with such a milestone here<BR>
        Between the words and linguistic terms<BR>
        The darkest evening of the year.<BR>
        It gives its stdout a shake<BR>
        To warn when there is some mistake.<BR>
        The only other sound's the sweep<BR>
        Of easy wind and working disks.<BR>
        The words are lovely, fresh and free.<BR>
        But we have promises to keep,<BR>
        And words to hunt before we sleep,<BR>
        And words to hunt before we sleep.<BR>

<P class="noindent">
On this shortest day, we announce a new version of Hspell - the free Hebrew
spell-checker.
</P>

<P class="noindent">
As usual, you can find the new release in the project's homepage, at:

</P>

<P class="noindent">
This release includes the following improvements:
</P>

<UL>
 <LI> Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   1,000 base words added.
 <LI> Portability improvements (thanks to Baruch Even).
 <LI> New run-time option -H causes hspell to accept He Ha-she'ela in the text.
 <LI> The "-n" option (for spelling hints, an explanation of certain kinds of
   errors) that was lost in version 0.6, is now back. The "likelyerrors"
   feature is still missing in this version.
 <LI> A new, and somewhat tentative, Documented C API (libhspell.a library,
   spell.h header, hspell.3 manual). These are not available in the normal
   RPM - compile the sources yourself if you want them.
 <LI> A full morphological analyzer (explaining all the possible ways to read
   a given word, how each reading was derived and its syntactic properties)
   is now available when Hspell is run with the "-l" option.
   Because the data files needed for this feature currently take up as much
   as 4 times the space needed only for spell-checking, this feature is not
   compiled by default, unless compilation is done with "make linginfo".
   Also, the normal RPM does not include this feature, but the "fat" RPM does
   include it.
</UL>

<P>
Hspell's Vocabulary is now 406,629 words (when including kinuyim on verbs)
based on 8042 nouns, 1783 adjectives, 5113 verb stems, and 1880 other words.
</P>

<P>
In recent months, Hspell has been increasingly used with various free-software
applications. We would like to thank Mitz Pettel, Meni Livne, Yaacov Zamir,
Mooffie and Alan Yaniger for their integration work and their suggestions.

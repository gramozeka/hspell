<P>
Release 0.7 was done on December 22, 2003, which was the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">winter solstice</A>.
About half a year later, we were ready to make another release, and decided
to make it <I>exactly</I> half a year later, in June 21, 2004, the date
of the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice">summer solstice</A>.
</P>
<P>
The summer solstice is indeed the <B>longest day</B> of the year, meaning
it has the most time of daylight.
</P>
<P>
We also refer to the distance the earth travelled around the sun since
the last release. Because the earth travels in an average radius of
one <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">Astronomical
unit</A> around the sun, and circumference of a circle is 2*PI*r, i.e.,
half of it is PI*r, the earth travelled approximately PI astronomical
units in the 6 months since the last release.

<H1>Hspell Release Announcements</H1>
<P>Traditionally,
announcements of new <A HREF="..">Hspell</A> releases have been more than
just a dry list
of new features. We tried to spice up the announcement by making it read
like a joke, a variation on a well-known speech, or something else our
artistic (twisted?) mind thought of before the release.
</P>
<P>These announcements were all sent to two relevant mailing lists,
<A HREF="http://ivrix.org.il/mailing-lists/">ivrix-discuss</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.iglu.org.il/mailing-lists/linux-il.html">linux-il</A>,
and you can also find here the collection of them all. Since many of
these announcements were intended to be <I>witty</I>, and some are parodies
on other (suposedly) famous texts, this site includes a short "references"
section for these announcements, pointing to the original parodied text.
This reference section was absent from the original announcements,
because, frankly, explaining a joke is quite silly ;)
</P>
<P>We hope that you will enjoy reading these announcements as much as we
have enjoyed writing them!

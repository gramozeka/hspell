Hspell 0.3 announcement
<BR><SPAN class="small">"Groundhog Day"</SPAN>
</H1>
<H3>The original announcement</H3>
<P>Earlier today, in the small town of Punxsutawney, PA, a cute little groundhog
woke up and got out of its hole. The first thing it saw was the URL:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
http://ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker/
<P class="noindent">In which it knew it could find a new release of the free Hebrew spell-checker, Hspell - release 0.3.</P>
<P class="noindent">The second thing it saw was its own shadow, which means, according to legend,
that we will not have another Hspell release for another six weeks.
Well, more-or-less six weeks... It's just a woodchuck after all, and not one
of the Hspell developers!
</P>
<P class="noindent">
Here's what it found in the new release:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: over
   1,000 base words and 20,000 inflections. In this release, emphasis has
   been put on adding Hebrew nouns and adjectives.</P>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  Fixed Makefile behavior in certain case. In particular "make" should work
   regardless of LC_* environment variables. However, as hspell currently
   works on iso8859-8 encoded files, users with a utf8 locale must run the
   "hspell" perl program as "LC_ALL=C hspell" (otherwise, they will see
   error messages from Perl).</P>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  Added ispell-like "-a" option, for interfacing with LyX.
   If you want to use hspell under LyX you should use Hebrew-enabled LyX
   (version 1.1.6fix4 is known to work). Add the following line to your
   .lyx/lyxrc file:<BR>
        \spell_command hspell<BR>
   Notice that this prevents using English ispell/aspell from within LyX. 
   If you know of a better configuration, please tell us.
   Notice that if a Hebrew misspelled word is found, it is shown reversed on
   LyX's spellchecker (and so are its corrections). This is about to be
   corrected in future releases of LyX. Also, LyX breaks Hebrew acronyms
   wrongly, and causes hspell to reject them.</P>
   <P class="noindent">
   Read http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~dekelts/lyx/instructions2.html for
   Hebrew LyX general instructions.</P>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  No longer incorrectly recognize שלווום (should be שלוום, "that to their
   hook").</P>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  The wolig.pl automatic inflector can handle country names, and many more
   country names and nationalities have been added. Note that since I did
   not find a source for "official" country-name spellings in Hebrew, our
   list might contain errors. Please tell us if you know a dictionary or other
   authoritative document which contains the official Hebrew spellings of
   country names.</P>
<LI><P class="noindent">
  Vocabulary: 189,347 words
               based on 5238 nouns, 927 adjectives, 3568 verb stems, and
               1203 other words</P>
</UL>
<P class="noindent">
They say "mishnichnas adar marbim besimcha". We didn't have too many reasons
to be happy in the last few days, but I do hope that at least some of you
will enjoy a fresh Hspell in the beginning of the new month. At least a little.
And if you don't, or find bugs, blame the groundhog (or better yet, tell us.)
<P>

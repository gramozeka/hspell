<P>
This release done in December 22, 2003, which happened to be (not entirely
by chance, of course) the date of the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">winter solstice</A>.
The winter solstice is indeed the shortest day of the year (i.e., the
day with least daylight time). Also, while it only formally marks the
<I>beginning</I> of winter (in the northern hemesphere, of course), it
is certainly associated with winter, and therefore a cold evening,
but not (at least in Israel), a snowy evening.
</P>
<P><I><B>Stopping By Woods On A
Snowy Evening</B></I> is a relatively well-known poem written in 1923 by
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost">Robert Frost</A>.
This poem is about the <I>darkest evening of the year</I>, which we
decided to equate with the winter solstice. We took the poem's structure,
but replaced much of the stanzas with spell-checking related sentences.
</P>
<P>Here is the original poem, in all its glory:</P>

<B><I><U>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening</U></I></B>
<B><I>(Robert Frost, 1923)</I></B><BR>
Whose woods these are I think I know.<BR>
His house is in the village though;<BR>
He will not see me stopping here<BR>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.<BR>
<BR>
My little horse must think it queer<BR>
To stop without a farmhouse near<BR>
Between the woods and frozen lake<BR>
The darkest evening of the year.<BR>
<BR>
He gives his harness bells a shake<BR>
To ask if there is some mistake.<BR>
The only other sound's the sweep<BR>
Of easy wind and downy flake.<BR>
<BR>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<BR>
But I have promises to keep,<BR>
And miles to go before I sleep,<BR>
And miles to go before I sleep.<BR>

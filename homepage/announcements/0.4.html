</CENTER>
<P>Four score and seven days ago my Unix mentor brought forth on this mailing
list a new software, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are lousy spellers.</P>
</P>Now we are engaged in a great effort, testing whether that software or
any free software so conceived and so dedicated can long endure and reach
revision 0.4. We are met on a great website</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker/
</P>
<P class=noindent>
We have come to dedicate a portion of that website as a final resting place
for the new version 0.4, created so that the nation might spell correctly.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
</P>
<P>The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can
never forget what the new version did:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and many more words added: as many
   as 2,300 new base words and 60,000 inflections.
<LI>Shem Poal Natuy + Kinuy for all verbs, things like: בהצטנני, בשבתו
 Complete overhaul of the hspell homepage. the site now also contains
   small (~100K) signed RPMs.
<LI>New option for mixed Hebrew-English spellchecking.
  In response to popular demand, long command line options were added.
</UL>
<P style=noindent>
We here highly resolve that this software shall not have been written in
vain - that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom - and
that spell-checker of the people, by the people, for the people shall not
perish from the earth.</P>

Hspell 0.5 announcement
<BR><SPAN class="small">"Gulliver's Travel"</SPAN>
</H1>
<H3><A HREF="0.5.html">The original announcement</A></H3>
<H3>References</H3>
<P>
The text of this announcement is a slightly modified version of a small
part of Jonathan
Swift's <A HREF="http://www.jaffebros.com/lee/gulliver/">Gulliver's Travels</A>.
The original text comes from <A HREF="http://www.jaffebros.com/lee/gulliver/bk4/chap4-1.html">chapter 1 of book 4</A> of Gulliver's Travels. In the original
story, Gulliver finds himself in a land of intelligent horses, and learns
from them the word they use for humans (<I>Yahoo</I>) and the more complicated
word they use to call themselves (<I>Houyhnhnm</I>). In our version, Gulliver
learns about Hspell 0.5 and the URL of  Hspell's homepage.
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the original text was modified only slightly; "Hat" was
changed to <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</A>, "lappet" changed
to laptop, and "Magicians" turned into programmers. A short introduction
alluding to Israel's 55th independence day (which happened a day earlier)
was added, as so was a finale explaining the new features of Hspell 0.5.
</P>
<P>
To make it easier to guess that this was a Gulliver's Travels parody,
the sender of this announcement was named "Lemuel Gulliver". A special
account lemuel_gul@yahoo.co.uk was created for this fake "Lemuel". The
choice of yahoo.co.uk was deliberate: Gulliver was an Englishman, and a
Yahoo (meaning a person, in the horses' language).

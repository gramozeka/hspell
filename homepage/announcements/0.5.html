Hspell 0.5 announcement

<H3>The original announcement</H3>
<P class="noindent">
Date: Wed, 7 May 2003<BR>
From: Lemuel Gulliver<BR>
Subject: Announce: Hspell 0.5<BR>
<BR>
<P>Yesterday, I was hiking in the Haifa area, enjoying Israel's fifty-fifth
independence day. All of the sudden, in a field not far from the Technion,
two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon my face
and hands. The gray steed rubbed my red hat all round with his right
fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much, that I was forced to adjust it better,
by taking it off, and settling it again; whereat both he and his companion
(who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised, the latter felt the
laptop on my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they both looked
with new signs of wonder.
<P>Upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and rational,
so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded, they must needs be
Programmers, who had been magically metamorphosed. Upon the strength of this
reasoning, I ventured to address them. The two creatures stood silent while
I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention; and when I had ended, they
neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious
conversation. 
<BR>
<P>I could frequently distinguish the word "Hspell 0.5", which was repeated by
each of them several times; and although it was impossible for me to
conjecture what it meant; yet while the two Horses were busy in conversation,
I endeavoured to practice this word upon my tongue; and as soon as they were
silent, I boldly pronounced "Hspell 0.5" in a loud voice, imitating, at the
same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse; at which they were
both visibly surprized, and the Gray repeated the same word twice, as if he
meant to teach me the right accent, wherein I spoke after him as well as I
could, and found myself perceivably to improve every time, though very far
from any degree of perfection. Then the Bay tried me with a second phrase,
much harder to be pronounced; but reducing it to the English orthography,
may be spelt thus:

<P>
I did not succeed in this so well as the former, but after two or three
farther trials, I had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my
capacity.
<P>
  After a long period of making an ass (or rather, a horse) of my self, the
two horses managed to explain to me what this "Hspell 0.5" was. They told
me that it had:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Some incorrect words purged or fixed, and about 2,000 base words added.

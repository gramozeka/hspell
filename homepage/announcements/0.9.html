Hspell 1.0 announcement
<BR><SPAN class="small">"Boring"</SPAN>
</H1>
<H3>The original announcement</H3>

<P class="noindent">
After eight Hspell releases with interesting announcements or release dates,
we've unfortunately run out of wacky ideas. So this announcement will be
totally boring and informative.
</P>

<P class="noindent">
We are proud to announce version 0.9 of Hspell, the free Hebrew spell-checker.
</P>

<P class="noindent">
As usual, you can find the new release in the project's homepage, at:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker/">http://ivrix.org.il/projects/spell-checker/</A>
</P>

<P class="noindent">
As Hspell is nearing its official "1.0" release, its coverage (vocabulary)
is becoming more and more complete. In this release, about 2,500 base words
were added - more than were added in any one of the previous releases.
</P>

<P>
While working on this release we also continued our effort to to bring
Hspell-based Hebrew spell-checking to common multi-lingual spell-checkers.
Hspell's dictionaries (full word list and valid prefix information) were
exported to formats used by other spell-checking frameworks. Such Hspell-
based Hebrew dictionaries are now available on the official sites of Aspell,
Mozilla and OpenOffice (see our website for links, and the WHATSNEW file for
build instructions).
</P>


<P class="noindent">
Other notable improvements in this release:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P class="noindent">
C API improvements: New hspell_set_dictionary_path() function to tell
Hspell where its dictionaries were installed. Fixed bug on UTF8 locales
and removed spurious printouts.
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P class="noindent">
"Hspell -a" (ispell-like pipe API) improvements: words can now be added to
personal dictionary. This means that the "Add word" in KDE, LyX, and other
Hspell-using applications will finally work.
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P class="noindent">
Fixed errors in the morphological analyzer ("-l" option, when built
with --enable-linginfo). Also, now if the "-l" and "-c" options are given
together to hspell, morphological analysis is given also for correction
suggestions, and those are given even for words which are already correct.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P class="noindent">
We also fixed many other bugs. Check out http://ivrix.org.il/bugzilla/ for
more details.
</P>

<P class="noindent">
P.S.<BR>
Come to think of it, this announcement was interesting after all -
it was Hspell's first totally boring announcement with a totally
insignificant date!

Frequently Asked Questions
</H1>

<H3>What is Hspell?</H3>
<P>
The Hspell project is a free Hebrew linguistic project.
</P>
<P>
Its primary goal is to create a free Hebrew spell-checker.
We have already achieved that goal, and you are invited to
<A HREF="download.html">Download</A> the latest version of the spell-checker.
It is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
</P>
<P>
In
addition to a spell-checker, the project also produced a Hebrew
morphological analyzer, which for every valid Hebrew word lists all of its
possible <I>readings</I> (combinations of prefix and inflected base word).
</P>
<P>
The secondary goal of the project is to make the algorithms and dictionaries, created
initially for the spell-checker, freely available. These could be used
in more sophisticated
research or applications that require Hebrew word lists or a Hebrew morphology
engine.
</P>
<P>
Such potential application areas might include search engines,
speech synthesis, and much much more. The availability of a free basis will
hopefully encourage free development on top of it, to the benefit of the
general Hebrew-speaking population.
</P>

<H3>Who wrote Hspell, and why?</H3>
<P>
Hspell was written by <A HREF="http://nadav.harel.org.il/">Nadav Har'El</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~danken/">Dan Kenigsberg</A>.
</P>
<P>
Both authors are avid supporters of free software. In January 2000, they 
realized that while support for Hebrew is growing in the big free software
projects (such as Web browsers and word processors), there are a few
Hebrew-specific programs that are not likely to miraculously appear.
One of these important missing pieces was a Hebrew spell-checker.
</P>
<P>
After an initial (and not very useful) proof-of-concept was produced,
Hspell development remained dormant until development resumed at full
steam in October 2002, and the first public release was made in December
of that year.
</P>

<H3>To use Hspell, do I need to download it from this site?</H3>
<P>
Probably not.
Noadays, most users of Hspell will never need to download it from this site.
Some will even enjoy Hebrew spell-checking without realizing that they are using
Hspell.
</P>
<P>
Today, all common multi-lingual spell-checking frameworks &mdash; <B>aspell</B>,
<B>myspell</B> and <B>hunspell</B> &mdash; have a Hebrew dictionary (built from
Hspell's data). Some major applications, like <B>OpenOffice</B> and
<B>Firefox</B>, include one of these frameworks, and allow users to easily
download the dictionary for any language, including Hebrew, as a plugin.
</P>
<P>In some operating systems, such as some distributions of Linux and
Mac OS X v10.6, spell-checking across the whole system depends on one of
these multi-lingual spell-checkers, so installing the Hebrew dictionary
(which is often an addon package of the distribution) gives all or many
applications Hebrew spell-checking support.
</P>
<P>Finally, some Web applications (<I>"software as a service"</I>), such
as Google's <B>Gmail</B> mail service, use Hspell to provide Hebrew
spell-checking to their users.
</P>

<H3>And if I still want to download the source?</H3>
<P>
There remain many good reasons to download Hspell from this site.
Your operating system might not include Hspell, or includes an old version.
You might want to look at the source code, or modify it. You might like to
use Hspell's spell-checking utility or library, both more efficient and
accurate than their multi-lingual conterparts. You might like to use one
of Hspell's advanced features such as morphological analysis. Or you might
like to use Hspell's data for something we've never envisioned.
</P>
<P>
You can <A HREF="download.html">download here</A> the source of the
latest version of Hspell. In the same page you can also find precompiled
binary packages of Hspell for a limited selection of platforms. All source
packages, and some binary packages, are signed with our GPG keys, and
for your protection it is recommended that you take advantage of that fact.
</P>
<P>
Note that Hspell was written on, and for, Unix-like platforms such as
Linux, BSD and Solaris. While it can be used, in theory, on any operating
system with the tools it needs (e.g., Perl is needed during compilation), please don't ask us to
help you tweak it for proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows,
unless you are willing to pay for our time.
You can also do it on your own, or use one of the several commercial Hebrew
spell-checkers that are available for Windows.
</P>
<H3>Can I try Hspell without installing anything?</H3>
<P>
If you want to try Hspell's spell-checking and morphological-analysis features
without downloading or installing anything, try
<A HREF="http://wassist.cs.technion.ac.il/~danken/cgi-bin/hspell.cgi">Hspell's
online demonstration</A>. In the Web form, can type Hebrew and see
your errors, suggested corrections, and (if you want) morphological analysis of
the correct words. 
</P>
<H3>What is Hspell's spelling standard?</H3>
<P>
Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with the official
niqqud-less spelling rules ("Ha-ktiv Khasar Ha-niqqud", colloquially known as
"Ktiv Male"). These rules are published by the Academy of the Hebrew Language and are <A HREF="http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision4.html">available online</A>, and as an appendix in most modern Hebrew dictionaries. All recently
published Hebrew dictionaries, including מילון ההווה, רב-מילים, and the
new (2004) edition of אבן שושן, use niqqud-less spelling.
</P>
<P>
Our strict compliance with these rules is both an
advantage and a disadvantage, depending on your viewpoint. It's an advantage
because it encourages a <B>correct</B> and consistent spelling style throughout
your writing. It is a disadvantage, because a few of the Academia's official
spelling decisions are relatively unknown to the general public, and sometimes
even disputed by popular publishers.
</P>
<P>
Users of Hspell (and all Hebrew writers, for that matter) are encouraged to 
read the Academia's official niqqud-less spelling rules, get to know them,
and start using them.
</P>
<P>
Future releases might include an option for alternative spelling standards.
</P>
<H3>But Hspell tells me to write
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1497&#1502&#1488</SPAN>" instead of
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1502&#1488</SPAN>", and
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1508&#1504&#1492</SPAN>" instead of
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1493&#1508&#1504&#1492</SPAN>", and even
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1502&#1514&#1497</SPAN>" instead of
"<SPAN LANG="he">&#1488&#1502&#1497&#1514&#1497</SPAN>"!</H3>
<P>
Please see the previous answer. We weren't kidding when we said that
Hspell is in 100% accordance to the Academia's niqqud-less spelling standard.
</P>
<P>
If you are curious why Hspell spells a particular word the way that it
does, please refer to our document <A HREF="niqqudless.pdf">סוגיות בכתיב
חסר הניקוד</A>. This 50-page document explains Hspell's spelling standard in
detail, and discusses spelling decisions that we had to take while developing
hspell &mdash; especially those which were more controversial.
</P>
<P>
If you really want Hspell to accept mis-spelled variants, you can add them
to your personal dictionary.
</P>
<H3>How does Hspell work?</H3>
<P>
The "<TT>hspell</TT>" program itself is a relatively-simple (but efficient) program
that looks up words in a large list of words. But the real
"brain" behind it is this word list (dictionary) provided by the Hspell
project.
</P>
<P>
In order for it to be completely free of other people's copyright restrictions,
the Hspell project is a clean-room implementation, not based on other
companies' word lists, on other companies' spell checkers, or on copying of
printed dictionaries. The word list is also not based on automatic scanning
of available Hebrew documents (such as online newspapers), because there is
no way to guarantee that such a list will be correct (not contain
misspellings, useless proper names, slang, and so on), complete (certain
inflections might not appear in the chosen samples) or consistent (especially
when it comes to niqqud-less spelling rules).
</P>
<P>
Instead, our idea was to write programs which know how to correctly inflect
Hebrew nouns and conjugate Hebrew verbs. The input to these programs is a
list of noun stems and verb roots, plus hints needed for the correct
inflection when these cannot be figured out automatically. These input files
are obviously an important part of the Hspell project. The <I>word list
generators</I> (written in Perl, and are also part of the Hspell project) then
create the complete word-list for use by the spellchecking program, <TT>hspell</TT>.
The generated lists are useful for much more than spellchecking, by the
way, and is one of the reasons the Hspell project is so exciting.
</P>
<P>
Although we wrote all of Hspell's code ourselves, we are truly indebted to
the old-style "open source" pioneers &mdash; people who wrote books instead of
hiding their knowledge in proprietary software. For the correct noun
inflections, Dr. Shaul Barkali's "The Complete Noun Book" has been a great
help. <A HREF="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ornan/">Prof. Uzzi Ornan</A>'s booklet "Verb Conjugation in Flow Charts" has been
instrumental in the implementation of verb conjugation, and Barkali's
"The Complete Verb Book" was used too.
During our work we have extensively used a number of Hebrew dictionaries,
including Even Shoshan, Millon Ha-hove and Rav-Milim, to ensure the correctness
of certain words. Various Hebrew newspapers and books, both printed and online,
were used for inspiration and for finding words we still do not recognize.
We wish to thank Cilla Tuviana and
<A HREF="http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~rl">Dr. Zvi Har'El</A> for their
assistance with some grammatical questions.
</P>
<H3>How do I use the "hspell" program?</H3>
<P>
When you install Hspell, the "<TT>hspell</TT>" program is installed on your
system. Like the traditional Unix <TT>spell(1)</TT>, <TT>hspell</TT> outputs
the sorted list  of incorrect words, and does not (yet) have a more friendly
interface for making these corrections for you. Unlike <TT>spell(1)</TT>,
however, hspell can suggest  possible corrections  for some spelling errors -
such suggestions are enabled with the <TT>-c</TT> (correct) and <TT>-n</TT>
(notes) options.
</P>
<P>
<TT>hspell</TT> comes with a good manual page, so please run "<TT>man hspell</TT>" (or look <A HREF="hspell.1.html">here</A>)
to learn more on what file encoding <TT>hspell</TT> expects, and how to use
it more effectively.
</P>
<P>
If (like most people) you prefer graphical user interfaces, your favorite editor word-processor
or mail application might already be able to use Hspell to do spellchecking!
See <I>"To use Hspell, do I need to download..."</I> above, or check out
<A HREF="Hspell-HOWTO.html">HOWTO use Hspell with...</A> for (somewhat archaic)
instructions.
</P>
<H3>What is on Hspell's horizon?</H3>
<P>
Between October 2002 and August 2003, Hspell development proceeded
at full steam, with major releases coming out once every 1-3 months.
as Hspell and its vocabulary matured, releases became sparser,
at first twice a year, and then every 1-3 years.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the work on the 0.* release series has been on enlarging
the project's dictionaries. When release 0.1 came out, it was estimated that
in typical documents about 10% of the valid Hebrew words would be mistakenly
marked as errors. By release 0.4, the estimated percentage is down to only 1%.
By release 1.0, Hspell's vocabulary is considered mature, and while words
are still being added (and more rarely, corrected), this is hppaning at
a much slower pace, which can explain the spare release schedule.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the 0.* series, and the beginning of the 1.*, we
also worked, and will continue to work, on making Hspell more useful for
the average user, and easier to embed
in other applications. This entails improving performance, supporting
well-defined and documented APIs, better supporting the needs of different
users (such different encodings, personal dictionaries, and alternative
spelling standards), and making features unique to Hspell (such as the
"spelling hints") stronger.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the 1.* series, Hspell should also be able to affix-
compress its word list. This will not affect the size of the word list
on disk (which is already optimally compressed to a tiny fraction of its
original size), but will lower Hspell's memory use and startup times (perhaps
even to the point where it could be used on embedded devices).
</P>
<P>
The 2.* series (if we dare look far-enough into the future) will give
Hspell more sophisticated linguistic capabilities, beyond those of
naive spell-checkers. What these might be we can only speculate at this
stage.
</P>
<H3>How can I help?</H3>
<P>
One ongoing task that takes up a significant amount of our time
is to find legal Hebrew words that Hspell still doesn't recognize, and
add them to the dictionary. As Hspell matures, it becomes harder and harder
for us to find quality missing words (especially verbs), and help from the
users is appreciated. You can help
by sending us verified lists of missing words. To make sure your list is
useful, please try to:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Check in your favorite dictionary that the word is indeed spelled correctly.
<LI>Check that the spelling you proposed is correct according to the Academia's
niqqud-less spelling rules (see above for details, and especially
<A HREF="niqqudless.pdf">our document</A>).
<LI>Check in <A HREF="http://wassist.cs.technion.ac.il/~danken/cgi-bin/hspell.cgi">this online Hspell interface</A> that the word in question hasn't been added since the last released version (the online interface is updated more often
than versions are released).
</OL>
